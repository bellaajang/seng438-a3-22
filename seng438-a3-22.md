# 1 Introduction

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for calculateColumnTotal and combine methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit tests

// As with any testing to be done, to begin with, a plan must be created. Document this test plan, as it will be included 
//with your lab report. This plan should include information about who will create which tests, how you plan to develop 
//tests to achieve the adequacy criteria.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

//pick 5 test cases that we made newly to answer

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

//Pros and cons of the coverage tools tried by your group in this assignment, in terms of reported measures, 
//integration with the IDE and other plug-ins, user friendliness, crashes, etc.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.
